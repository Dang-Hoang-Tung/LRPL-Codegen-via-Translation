/**
 * Recursively finds the smallest directory that can be deleted to free at least the given size.
 *
 * Traverses the file system tree starting from the given entry, skipping non-directories and
 * those smaller than the required size. For each directory, it checks its children and
 * updates the candidate directory if a smaller valid one is found. If no smaller child fits,
 * the current directory is returned as the valid candidate.
 *
 * @param size the minimum required size that the directory must free.
 * @param entry the current file system entry to evaluate (could be a directory or file).
 * @return the smallest directory entry that meets or exceeds the size requirement, or null if none found.
