/**
 * Calculates the total score for part 1 of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
 *
 * Reads the input into rounds, converts characters to numeric values representing shapes,
 * then computes the outcome of each round based on the difference between opponent's and
 * player's moves. Each round's score is the sum of the shape value and the outcome points
 * (win, draw, or loss), and all rounds are accumulated into a final score.
 *
 * @return The total score as an integer across all rounds.
