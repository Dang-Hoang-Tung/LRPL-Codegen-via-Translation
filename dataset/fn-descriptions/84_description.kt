/**
 * Computes a partial term of the clumsy factorial expression starting at position i.
 *
 * Depending on the modulo of i by 4, this function applies multiplication, division,
 * and sign adjustment rules to generate the correct segment value and the next index
 * to continue from. Special handling is applied for the first segment (i == 0).
 *
 * @param N the number for which the clumsy factorial is being computed.
 * @param i the current position offset within the sequence of operations.
 * @return a pair where the first element is the computed segment value (possibly signed)
 *         and the second element is the next index offset to continue iteration from.
