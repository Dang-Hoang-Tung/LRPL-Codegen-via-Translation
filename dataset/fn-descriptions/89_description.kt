/**
 * Computes the minimum cost required to make two baskets identical by swapping items.
 *
 * The function compares the counts of each integer in both baskets, determines which items 
 * need to be swapped to balance frequencies, and calculates the minimal swap cost. A swap 
 * can be performed directly between two items or indirectly through the globally smallest 
 * item to minimize cost.
 *
 * @param basket1 the first basket represented as an array of integers
 * @param basket2 the second basket represented as an array of integers
 * @return the minimum total cost to make both baskets identical, or -1 if impossible
