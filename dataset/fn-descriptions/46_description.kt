/**
 * Recursively searches the trie for a word starting at a given index.
 *
 * Matches the current character of the word with the corresponding child node in the trie. 
 * If the character is a dot (`.`), it is treated as a wildcard and the function attempts 
 * to continue searching down all child branches. The recursion continues until the end of 
 * the word is reached or no valid path is found.
 *
 * @param word the string to search for, which may contain wildcard dots ('.')
 * @param index the current position in the word being processed
 * @return true if the word matches any branch in the trie, false otherwise
